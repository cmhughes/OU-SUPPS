So you want to contribute to OU-SUPPS? 

You are very welcome to help with this project (that's why it's on Github), but please follow a few guidelines so that your pull requests can be accepted.


* PRINCIPLES

OU-SUPPS, above everything else, must be usable. That means it must be prepared with the standard user in mind, not TeX developers. Reputation is everything: we need the goodwill of users to continue, so that when issues do arise they are sympathetic.

1. Keep it simple: We aim to provide a system that is easy-to-use, and does most things for most people. This means that not every feature request will be implemented, in favour of having something that we know will "just work". 

2. Keep it simple II: Tempting though it is to add LaTeX packages to do whizzy things, that's not the aim of OU-SUPPS. We do use packages, but the more packages we rely on, the greater the chance that something breaks down the line.

3. Keep it simple III: How the end-user interacts with the system needs to be natural. 

4. Documentation: Nothing gets released without documentation. Ever.

* WHAT CAN YOU DO?

Take a look at the current list of issues and see if any take your fancy. Talk to rbrignall if you want suggestions for which to look at, and potential timeframes for releases.

By all means identify your own enhancements, but please add these as issues so that we know what's happening.

* HOW DO I DO IT?

Assuming you know how to use Github, all pull requests need to go on to the develop branch (or a sub-branch thereof). 

Remember there are four class files: does your work apply to others, too? 

Please cross-reference issues in your commits.
