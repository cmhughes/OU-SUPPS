The University has to ensure as far as possible that the work submitted by 
students is their own and that credit is not given for unreferenced material 
from other sources. The University statement `What constitutes 
plagiarism or cheating' appears in the Plagiarism Policy Document and in 
your Assessment Handbook and you are expected to have familiarised 
yourself with it. Please be aware that the University may subject your 
work to checks (including computerised checks) for plagiarism and in some 
instances may need to seek further information from you. Any cases where 
a basis for concern about the originality of the work is identified will be 
considered under the University's policy on academic conduct. 

I confirm that I have read the statement `What constitutes plagiarism or 
cheating' and that my answers will be my own work. \bigskip
