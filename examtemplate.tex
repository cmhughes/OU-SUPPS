\question[optional space for title]
The first question.\marks{12}

\begin{solution}
Solutions can be placed in-line, to generate solution files from the same source.\marks{3}

Inside solutions, notes can be added to the marks.\solnmarksplus{4}{Like this}
\end{solution}

\question
The second question.\marks{3}

\begin{solution}
Solutions can be placed in-line, to generate solution files from the same source.\marks{3}
\end{solution}

\question[(example of creating subquestions)]

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the standard enumerate environment.\marks{3}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item Sub-sub part.\marks{2}
\item Sub-sub part.\marks{2}
\begin{solution}
Solutions can be created per sub-question, or per sub-sub-question, or after the entire question.\marks{2}
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
The enumitem package allows numbering to be resumed later, to replace the OUTeX `intertext' command.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
\item Numbering continues from before.\marks{4}
\end{enumerate}



\question
\emph{This question is about nothing in particular.}
\begin{enumerate}
\item one\marks 4
\item two, with a sufficiently long question that it runs over more than one line.\marks{4}
\item 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sub-sub\marks 2
\item Sub-sub that is sufficiently long that it runs over more than one line.\marks 2
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Multiple choice questions}


\question
Choose an option.
\begin{options}
\item There are no options
\item There is one option
\item This option is the wrong choice
\end{options}


\question
Choose an inline option.
\begin{inlineoptions}{5} %parameter specifies number of columns
\item yes
\item no
\item maybe
\item well...
\item never!
\item yes
\item yes
\item yes
\noitem %HACK. adds "blank" space so that the items line up as expected
\noitem
\end{inlineoptions}

\question
Choose an inline option.
\begin{inlineoptions}[1.5]{3} %optional parameter specifies line spacing
\item yes
\item no
\item maybe
\item well...
\item never!
\item yes
\item yes
\item yes
\noitem %HACK. adds "blank" space so that the items line up as expected
\end{inlineoptions}

\section{Section title}

The class file is based on the standard article class file, so commands such as section, subsection etc. can all be used if desired.

%% Optional section, if you want to insert solutions at the end of the document to form a mark scheme.

\solutions

Another way to generate solutions is to use the solutions switch at the end of the file. These will appear irrespective of the showsolutions option.

\question[optional space for title]
The solution to the first question.\marks{12}

\question
The solution to the second question.\marks{3}
